# ENGEE281
A Repo showcasing a line following robot created for a second-year engineering project.
The ENGMT280 Report provides more information on the process of designing and using the robot.
LineFollow.py is the main code running on the robot, enabling it to follow a line, detect forks in the track, choose the appropriate direction, and communicate with another Raspberry Pi wirelessly.
CameraTower.py is the code that ran on a Raspberry Pi connected to a camera. This sent user-selected directions to the robot, using machine vision to interpret the directions given.
